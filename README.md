# Amnista

### Assignment for the course C#2 at NHL-Stenden

To test the application, the user should start several instances of Amnista.
One of the instances should be in server mode, with the server started. 
Any number of instances can be started in client mode, which is the default mode.
You can set your name on the profile page.
Now you will have to enter the IP of the server, which will be the IP of the device you are running the application instances on. The clients will then automatically connect to the server.
Once you are all set up, you can check whether the clients have connected on the server mode page. 


#### The rules are as follows:
- One of the clients starts a coffee vote on the home page of the application;
- The other clients are now prompted to join the voting session;
- You can simply press yes to join, which will take the client to the page with the wheel of fortune;
- The voting session will end after a given period of time, at which moment a "winner" is declared;
- The declared winner has to retrieve the ordered drinks, every users wishes will be shown on the server.
